This is an optional SQL insert created by dmanbob over on AC-Web
that adds some generic NPCs with Smart scripts to just populate your server

Origin thread: http://www.ac-web.org/forums/showthread.php?182845-Horde-and-Alliance-NPC-s-with-smart-scripts

Some info and changelogs:
Added: (in/out of combat shouts, honor for kills, more weapon sets, random weapon equips) (to equip diff weap sets once NPC is spawned run this query update creature set equipment_id=-1 where id>45000 and id<46039; (gm type .npc set spawndist value) to make NPC move randomly in a radius)

ADDED: Individual names for 80 different NPC's, added Individual looks and more in and out of combat shouts! 3 weapon sets each ENJOY!!! Note: NPC's are from Horde 45000-45039 Alliance 46000-46039 . Minions are in 81000 to 82000 range and will spawn in combat for Warlocks, Hunters and DK's.

BE SMART AND BACKUP YOUR SERVER BEFORE ADDING ANYTHING TO IT
